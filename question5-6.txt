Question 5:

If a robot that has just finished a task is immediately assigned a new task, this could create an infinte loop of the
robot completing its task and starting again. If this occurs, there is a possibility of the the other robots never being 
able to start their task and the program not ending. Another possible cause to this probelm would be the assignment of a 
new task prior to the completion of the task, i.e. the robot must continue to do tasks until the program is eventually 
aborted.

A possible solution to the first problem would be to ensure that any robot beginning a task has not yet completed its 
task. This can be done most simply through the use of a conditional statement that determines if the robot has completed 
its task prior to starting. A solution to the second problem would be the implimentation of a pause in the given thread
that is operating at that moment. So long as the robot is designated as finishing its task before this pause, and the
implimentation of a conditional statement as previously memtioned, the robot will be marked as complete prior to the 
program finishing its task. However so long as the task is completed and there are no issues (as expected in Q2), this is
not a problem.
